        <p>Set in a future where time is equated with wealth, Will Salas, portrayed by Justin Timberlake, 
            lives a life of poverty with a scant day's worth of time on his clock. His fate takes a dramatic 
            turn when he rescues Henry Hamilton, played by Matt Bomer, from time bandits, and in return, he's bestowed
             with a century of life. This substantial transaction, however, draws the watchful eyes of the authorities. 
             Falsely accused of a murder he didn't commit, Will finds himself on the run, accompanied by the daughter
              of a tremendously affluent man, portrayed by Amanda Seyfried.</p>
